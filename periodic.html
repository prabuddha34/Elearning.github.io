<p><strong><u>Exercise:5 A </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What is the need for classification of elements? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Classification is necessary to make comparative study easier. Following are the reasons for the classification of elements</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification allows the study of elements in an organised manner.</li>
<li>It helps in correlating the properties of elements concerning fundamental properties of all states of matter.</li>
<li>It defines the relationship of one element with another.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. What was the basis of the earliest attempts made for classification and grouping of elements? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Basis of earliest attempts made for classification and grouping of elements is based on malleability, ductility and density and also to consider whether they are metals and nonmetals.</p>
<p><strong>3. (a) A, B and C are the elements of a Dobereiner&#8217;s triad. if the atomic mass of A is 7 and that of C is 39, what should be the atomic mass of B? (b) Why was Dobereiner&#8217;s triad discarded? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Atomic. wt. of A = 7, At. wt. of C = 39</p>
<p><img title="icse selina class 9 chemistry chapter 5 sol" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/icse-selina-class-9-chemistry-chapter-5-sol-1.png" alt="icse selina class 9 chemistry chapter 5 sol-1" /></p>
<p>At. wt. of B = 23</p>
<p>i.e. Average of weights of A and C.</p>
<p>b) Dobereiner&#8217;s triad discarded because it failed to arrange all the known elements in the form of triads.</p>
<p><strong>4. Explain &#8216;Newland&#8217;s law of Octaves.&#8217; Why was the law discarded? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Newland&#8217;s law of Octaves explains when elements are arranged by increasing atomic mass, the properties of every eighth element starting from any element are a repetition of the properties of the starting element.</p>
<p>Newland&#8217;s law of Octaves was discarded for the following reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification did not work with heavier elements beyond Calcium.</li>
<li>Newland classified two elements Cobalt and Nickel in the same slot, and these were placed in the same column as Fluorine, Chlorine and Bromine.</li>
<li>Iron which resembles Cobalt and Nickel was placed far away from these elements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Did Dobereiners triads also exist in the columns of Newland&#8217;s Octaves? Compare and find out. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Döbereiner&#8217;s triads also exist in the columns of Newland&#8217;s octaves. For example, the second column of Newlands classification has the elements Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K), which constitute a Döbereiner&#8217;s triad.</p>
<p><strong>6. (a) Lithium. sodium and potassium elements were put in one group on the basis of their similar properties. What are those similar properties </strong></p>
<p><strong>(b) The elements calcium, strontium and barium were put in one group or family on the basis of their similar properties. Whit were those similar properties? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><strong>a)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have one electron in the outermost shell.</li>
<li>They form unipositive ions</li>
<li>they are good reducing agents</li>
<li>All these are soft metals.</li>
<li>All these metals impart colour to the flame</li>
<li>The common name of the group is alkali metals [Group 1A].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All are metals</li>
<li>Their oxides are alkaline</li>
<li>Each has valency 2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. (a) What was Mendeleev&#8217;s basis for classification of elements? </strong></p>
<p><strong>(b) Mendeleev&#8217;s contributions to the concept of a periodic table laid the foundation for the Modern Periodic Table. Give reasons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>a) The basis for Mendeleev&#8217;s are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Similarities in the chemical properties of elements.</li>
<li>Increasing order of atomic weights of elements.</li>
<li>Periodicity of properties of elements</li>
</ul>
<p>b) Mendeleev laid the foundation for the Modern Periodic Table by classifying 63 elements in increasing order of their atomic masses. He arranged them in 8 groups by leaving gaps for undiscovered elements and predicting their properties. He made separate groups for metals and non-metals. He also created periods in which the element gradually changes from metallic to non-metallic character. He was also able to show that the element in the same sub-group had the same valency.</p>
<p><strong>8. State Mendeleev’s periodic law.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Mendeleev’s periodic law states that the physical and chemical properties of all the elements are a periodic function of their atomic masses.</p>
<p><strong>9. Use Mendeleev’s periodic Law to predict the formula of </strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) hydrides of carbon and silicon </strong></p>
<p><strong>(b) Oxides of potassium, aluminium and barium. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>a)</p>
<p>C is in Group 4. So, the hydride will be CH<sub>4</sub> (Methane).</p>
<p>Si is in Group 4. So, the hydride will be SiH<sub>4</sub> (Silane).</p>
<p>b)</p>
<p>K is in Group 1. So, the oxide will be K2O (Potassium oxide).</p>
<p>Al is in Group 3. So, the oxide will be Al2O3 (Aluminium oxide).</p>
<p>Ba is in Group 2. So, the oxide will be BaO (Barium oxide).</p>
<p><strong>10. Which group of elements was missing from Mendeleev&#8217;s original periodic table ? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Anomalous pairs of elements like Argon, Cobalt and Tellurium were missing from Mendeleev&#8217;s periodic table.</p>
<p><strong>11. State the merits of Mendeleev&#8217;s classification of elements. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Merits of Mendeleev&#8217;s classification of elements are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>It generalised the study of the elements.</li>
<li>Mendeleev left some gaps in his periodic table for subsequent inclusion of elements not known at that time.</li>
<li>He predicted the properties of then-unknown elements on the basis of the property of elements lying adjacent to the vacant slots.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12. Why did Mendeleev leave some gaps in his periodic table of elements? Explain your answer with an example. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Mendeleev left some gaps in his periodic table of elements for the undiscovered elements. For example, Mendeleev discovered eka-silicon with an atomic mass of 72, which was later named Germanium with atomic mass 72.6.</p>
<p><strong>13. The atomic number of an element is more important to the chemist than its relative atomic mass. Why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Atomic number represents a number of the electron in an element. Most of the chemical property of an element depends on electrons in their outermost shell which is called a valency shell. Hence, the atomic number is more important to a chemist than its relative atomic mass.</p>
<p><strong>14. Consider the following elements: Be, Li, Na, Ca, K. Name the elements of (a) same group (b) same period. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>a) Same IA group (Li, Na, K) and IIA group (Be, Ca)</p>
<p>b) In the second period (Be, Li) and in the fourth period (K, Ca)</p>
<p><strong>15. (a) Name an element whose properties were predicted on the basis of its position in Mendeleev&#8217;s periodic table. </strong></p>
<p><strong>(b) Name two elements whose atomic weights were corrected on the basis of their positions in Mendeleev&#8217;s periodic table. </strong></p>
<p><strong>(c) How many elements were known at the time of Mendeleev&#8217;s classification of elements?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Eka- Silicon</li>
<li>Gold and Platinum</li>
<li>63</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Exercise:5 B </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. a) State the modern Periodic table law.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b) How many periods and groups are there in the modern periodic table</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>a) The modern periodic table states that Physical and chemical properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic numbers.</p>
<p>b) 18 groups and 7 periods</p>
<p><strong>2. What are the main characteristics of the last elements in the periods of a periodic table? What is the general name of such elements?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>The main character of the last element of a periodic table in their outermost shells is completely filled by either two or 8 electrons. These elements are known as Inert gases.</p>
<p><strong>3, What is meant in the periodic table by : </strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) a group, and </strong></p>
<p><strong>(b) a period? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>A Group is a set of chemical elements in the same vertical column of the periodic table. The elements in a group have similarities in the electronic configuration of their atoms, and thus they exhibit somewhat related physical and chemical properties.</p>
<p>Horizontal row in a periodic table are called as periods.</p>
<p><strong>4, From the standpoint of atomic structure, what determines which element will be the first and which the last in a period of the periodic table ? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>From the standpoint of atomic structure, <strong>Atomic number</strong> determines which element will be the first and which the last in a period of the periodic table.</p>
<p><strong>5. (a) What are the following groups known as? </strong></p>
<p><strong>(i) Group 1 (ii) Group 17 (iii) Group _18 (b) Name two elements of each group. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Group 1- alkali metals Ex: Lithium, sodium</p>
<p>Group 17- halogens- Fluorine.Chlorine.</p>
<p>Group 18 – Noble gases Ex: Neon(Ne), Argon(Ar)</p>
<p><strong>6. What is the number of elements in the : (a) 1st period, and (b) 3rd period, of the modern periodic table?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>a) The first period consists of two elements.</p>
<p>b) The first period consists of eight elements.</p>
<p><strong>7. How does the number of i) Valence electrons ii) valency vary on moving from left to right</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>In the second period of a periodic table</strong></li>
<li><strong>In the third period of a periodic table</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><strong>a) </strong></p>
<p>i) The valence electrons in the same shell (outermost shell) increase progressively by one across the period.</p>
<p>ii) On moving from left to right in a period, valency increases from 1 to 4, then falls to one and ultimately to zero in the last group.</p>
<p>b)</p>
<p>i) Valence electrons in the same shell (outermost shell) increase progressively by one across the period.</p>
<p>ii) On moving from left to right in the third period, valency increases from 1 to 7 and ultimately to zero in the last group.</p>
<p><strong>8. How do atomic structures (electron arrangement) change in a period with an increase in atomic numbers, moving left to right? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>When moving from left to right in a period the size of atoms decreases thus, in a particular period, the alkali metal atoms are the largest and the halogen atoms are the smallest.</p>
<p><strong>9. This question refers to elements of the periodic table with atomic numbers from 3 to 18. In the table below, some elements are shown by letters, even though the letters are not the usual symbols of the elements.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(b) Comment on the (i) reactivity (ii) colour and (iii) physical state of group 17 elements. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>a) Group 17 elements are called halogens. The name halogens are from Greek halo (sea salt) and gens (producing, forming) and thus means &#8216;sea salt former&#8217;. Group 17 consists of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine which form salts. Hence they are called as Halogens.</p>
<p>b)</p>
<p>i) Reactivity: Halogens are the most reactive non-metals; their reactivity decreases down the group. Fluorine is the most reactive halogen, and iodine is the least reactive halogen.</p>
<p>ii) Colour: Fluorine is a pale yellow gas, chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas, bromine is a reddish-brown liquid and iodine is a violet solid.</p>
<p>iii) Physical state: Gaseous</p>
