<h2>Selina Solutions for Class 9 Physics Chapter 2 &#8211; Motion in One Dimension</h2>
<p>The chapter provides details to some terms related to motion such as different types of quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalar</li>
<li>Vector</li>
</ul>
<p>The various aspects of rest and motion, distance and displacement- the difference between the two quantities, their representation etc. Speed and velocity are concepts that are often correlated, through this chapter we understand their difference and solve numerical problems on it. Graphical representation of linear motion through &#8211; velocity-time graph, displacement-time graph, acceleration-time graph are also depicted along with examples.</p>
<p>Towards the end, the chapter also discusses the equations of uniformly accelerated motion, their derivations through different methods, etc.</p>

<p>A body is referred to be in a state of rest or stationary when there is no change in the position of the body with regards to its immediate surroundings.</p>
</div></div></section><section itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name text">When is a body said to be in motion?</h3><div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text">
<p>A body is referred to be in a state of motion when there are changes in the position of the body with regards to its immediate surroundings.</p>
</div></div></section><section itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name text">What do you mean by motion in one direction?</h3><div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Motion in one direction with reference to a body is when the body moves in a straight line path only.</p>
</div></div></section><section itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name text">Define displacement.</h3><div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Displacement is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of the body â€“ magnitude wise. The direction of displacement is considered from the initial position to the final position. The S.I unit of displacement is the metre (m).</p>
</div></div></section><section itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name text">Define velocity.</h3><div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Velocity can be defined as the distance covered per second by a body in a particular direction. The S.I. unit of velocity is metre/second (m/s).</p>
</div></div></section><section itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name text">Define speed?</h3><div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Speed can be defined as the rate of change of distance with regards to time. The S.I. unit of time is metre/second (m/s).</p>
</div></div></section><section itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name text">When is the instantaneous speed the same as the average speed?</h3><div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The instantaneous speed is the same as the average speed when the acceleration of the body is zero. In order for the acceleration to be zero, neither the speed nor the direction changes.</p>
</div></div></section><section itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name text">Define acceleration.</h3><div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Acceleration can be defined as the rate of change of velocity with time. It can also be defined as the increase in velocity per second. The S.I unit of acceleration is meter per second square or ms-2.</p>
</div></div></section><section itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name text">What is meant by the term retardation?</h3><div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Retardation can be defined as the decrease in the velocity per second. Since negative acceleration is retardation, its S.I. unit is the same as acceleration.</p>
