</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
(i) Given: P = ₹6,000; N = 3 years and R = 5%
</p>
<p>
For the 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹6000; N = 1 year and R = 5%
</p>
<p>
Interest = (6000 x 5 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹300
</p>
<p>
And, amount = ₹(6000 + 300)
</p>
<p>
= ₹6,300
</p>
<p>
For the 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹6300; N = 1 year and R = 5%
</p>
<p>
Interest = (6300 x 5 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹315
</p>
<p>
And, amount = ₹(6300 + 315)
</p>
<p>
= ₹6,615
</p>
<p>
For the 3<sup>rd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹6,615; N = 1 year and R = 5%
</p>
<p>
Interest = (6615 x 5 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹330.75
</p>
<p>
And, amount = ₹(6,615 + 330.75)
</p>
<p>
= ₹6,945.75
</p>
<p>
Hence, the C.I. accrued = Final amount – Initial principal
</p>
<p>
= ₹6,945.75 &#8211; ₹6,000
</p>
<p>
= ₹945.75
</p>
<p><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
For the 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹8,000; N = 1 year and R = 15%
</p>
<p>
Interest = (8000 x 15 x 1)/100
</p>

= ₹9,200
</p>
<p>
For the 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹9,200; N = 1 year and R = 15%
</p>
<p>
Interest = (9200 x 15 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,380
</p>
<p>
And, amount = ₹(9,200 + 1,380)

= ₹10,580
</p>
<p>
For the next ½ year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹10,580; N = ½ year and R = 15%
</p>
<p>
Interest = (10580 x 15 x ½)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹793.50
</p>
<p>
And, amount = ₹(10,580 + 793.50)
</p>
<p>
= ₹11,373.50
</p>
<p>
Hence, the C.I. accrued = Final amount – Initial principal

<p>
= ₹11,373.50 &#8211; ₹8,000
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,373.50

<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
(i) For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹4,600; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (4600 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹460
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(4,600 + 460)
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,060
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹5,060; R = 12% and T = 1 year.
</p>
<p>
I = (5060 x 12 x1)/100
</p>
<p>
= 60720/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹607.20 
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(5,060 + 607.20)
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,667.20
</p>
<p>
Compound interest = ₹(5,667.20 – 4,600)
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,067.20
</p>
<p>
Amount after 2 years = ₹5,667.20
</p>
<p>
(ii) For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹16,000; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (16000 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,600
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(16,000 + 1,600)
</p>
<p>
= ₹17,600
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹17,600; R = 14% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (17600 x 14 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= 246400/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,464 
</p>
<p>
And, 
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(17,600 + 2,464)
</p>
<p>
= ₹20,064
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> year,
</p>
<p>
P = ₹20,064; R = 15% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (20064 x 15 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,009.60
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after 3 years = ₹(20,064 + 3,009.60)
</p>
<p>
= ₹23,073.60
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
Compound interest = ₹(23,073.60 – 16,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹7,073.60

<p><strong>4. Find the compound interest, correct to the nearest rupee, on </strong>₹<strong>2,400 for 2½ years at 5 per cent per annum.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹2400; R = 5% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (2400 x 5 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹120
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(2400 + 120)
</p>
<p>
= ₹2520
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹2520; R = 5% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (2520 x 5 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹126 
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(2,520 + 126)
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,646
</p>
<p>
For the final ½ year
</p>
<p>
P = Rs. 2646; R = 5% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
I = (2646 x 5 x 1)/(100 x 2)
</p>
<p>
= ₹66.15
</p>
<p>
Amount after 2½ years = ₹2,646 + ₹66.15
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,712.15
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
Compound interest = ₹(2,712.15 – 2,400)
</p>
<p>
= ₹312.15
</p>
<p><strong>5. Calculate the compound interest for the second year on </strong>₹<strong>8,000 invested for 3 years at 10% per annum.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹8,000; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (8000 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= 800
</p>
<p>
And, 
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(8,000 + 800) = ₹8,800
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹8,800; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (8800 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹880 
</p>
<p>
Hence,  
</p>
<p>
Compound interest for 2<sup>nd</sup> years = ₹880

<p><strong>6. A borrowed </strong>₹<strong>2,500 from B at 12% per annum compound interest. After 2 years, A gave </strong>₹<strong>2,936 and a watch to B to clear the account. Find the cost of the watch.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹2500; R = 12% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (2500 x 12 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹300
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(2,500 + 300) = ₹2,800
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹2,800; R = 12% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (2800 x 12 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹336
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(2,800 + 336) = ₹3136
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
Amount repaid by A to B = ₹2936
</p>
<p>
The amount of watch = ₹(3136 – 2936) = ₹200
</p>
<p><strong>7. How much will </strong>₹<strong>50,000 amount to in 3 years, compounded yearly, if the rates for the successive years are 6%, 8% and 10% respectively?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Given: P = ₹50,000; T = 3 years
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 1<sup>st</sup> year, R = 6%
</p>
<p>
I = (P x R x T)/100
</p>
<p>
= (50000 x 6 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,000
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after the 1<sup>st</sup> year = ₹(3,000 + 50,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹53,000
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year, R = 8% and P = ₹53,000
</p>
<p>
I = (P x R x T)/100
</p>
<p>
= (53000 x 8 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,240
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after the 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹(4,240 + 53,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹57,240
</p>
<p>
Next,
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 3<sup>rd</sup> year, R = 10% and P = ₹57,240
</p>
<p>
I = (P x R x T)/100
</p>
<p>
= (57240 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,724
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after the<sup> </sup>3<sup>rd</sup> year = ₹(5,724 + 57,240)
</p>
<p>
= ₹62,964
</p>
<p>
Hence, the amount after 3 years will be ₹62,964

<p><strong>8. Meenal lends </strong>₹<strong>75,000 at C.I. for 3 years. If the rate of interest for the first two years is 15% per year and for the third year it is 16%, calculate the sum Meenal will get at the end of the third year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Given: P = ₹75,000; T = 3 years
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 1<sup>st</sup> year, R = 15%
</p>
<p>
I = (P x R x T)/100
</p>
<p>
= (75000 x 15 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹11,250
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after the 1<sup>st</sup> year = ₹(75,000 + 11,250)
</p>
<p>
= ₹86,250
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year, R = 15% and P = ₹86,250
</p>
<p>
I = (P x R x T)/100
</p>
<p>
= (86250 x 15 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹12,937.50
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after the 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹(12,937.50 + 86,250)
</p>
<p>
= ₹99,187.50
</p>
<p>
Next,
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 3<sup>rd</sup> year, R = 16% and P = ₹99,187.50
</p>
<p>
I = (P x R x T)/100
</p>
<p>
= (99187.50 x 16 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹15,870
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after the<sup> </sup>3<sup>rd</sup> year = ₹(15,870 + 99,187.50)
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,15,057.5
</p>
<p>
Hence, at the end of 3 years Meenal will get an amount of ₹1,15,057.5

<p><strong>9. Govind borrows </strong>₹<strong>18,000 at 10% simple interest. He immediately invests the money borrowed at 10% compound interest compounded half-yearly. How much money does Govind gain in one year?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
Calculating the simple interest
</p>
<p>
P = ₹18,000; R = 10% and T = 1year, we have
</p>
<p>
S.I.= (18000 x 10 x 1)/100 
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,800
</p>
<p>
Calculating the compound interest (compounded half-yearly)
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> half- year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹18,000; R = 10% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (18000 x 10 x 1)/(100 x 2)
</p>
<p>
= ₹900
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹18,000 + ₹900 = ₹18,900
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> half-year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹18,900; R = 10% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (18,900 x 10 x 1)/(100 x 2)
</p>
<p>
= ₹945 Rs 
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹18,900 + ₹945 = ₹19,845
</p>
<p>
Then,
</p>
<p>
Compound interest = ₹(19,845 -18,000) = ₹1,845
</p>
<p>
Therefore,
</p>
<p>
Govind’s gain = ₹(1,845 &#8211; 1,800) = ₹45

</p>
<p>
Given: P = ₹4,000; T = 3 years
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 1<sup>st</sup> year, R = 8%
</p>
<p>
I = (P x R x T)/100
</p>
<p>
= (4000 x 8 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹320
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after the 1<sup>st</sup> year = ₹(4,000 +320)
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,320
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year, R = 10% and P = ₹4,320
</p>
<p>
I = (P x R x T)/100
</p>
<p>
= (4320 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹432
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after the 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹(432 + 4,320)
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,752
</p>
<p>
Next,
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 3<sup>rd</sup> year, R = 10% and P = ₹4,752
</p>
<p>
I = (P x R x T)/100
</p>
<p>
= (4,752 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹475.20
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount after the<sup> </sup>3<sup>rd</sup> year = ₹(475.20 + 4,752)

<p>
= ₹5,227.20
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
The compound interest = ₹(5227.20 – 4,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,227.20
</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2(B)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Calculate the difference between the simple interest and the compound interest on </strong>₹<strong>4,000 in 2 years at 8% per annum compounded yearly.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹4,000; R = 8% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (4,000 x 8 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹320
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(4,000 + 320)
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,320
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹4,320; R = 8% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (4,320 x 8 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹345.60
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(4,320 + 345.60)
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,665.60
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
Compound interest = ₹(4,665.60 – 4,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹665.60
</p>
<p><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
Simple interest for 2 years = (4000 x 8 x 2)/100 
</p>
<p>
  = ₹640
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
Difference of CI and SI = ₹(665.60 – 640)
</p>
<p>
= ₹25.60
</p>
<p><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>2. A man lends </strong>₹<strong>12,500 at 12% for the first year, at 15% for the second year and at 18% for the third year. If the rates of interest are compounded yearly ; find the difference between the C.I. for the first year and the compound interest for the third year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = Rs. 12500; R = 12% and R = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (12500 x 12 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,500
</p>
<p>
And,<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(12,500 + 1,500)
</p>
<p>
= ₹14,000
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹14,000; R = 15% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (14000 x 15 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,100
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(1,400 + 2,100)
</p>
<p>
= ₹16,100
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹16,100; R = 18% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (16100 x 18 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹2898
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(16,100 + 2,898)
</p>
<p>
= ₹18,998
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
The difference between the compound interest of the third year and first year
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,898 &#8211; ₹1,500
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,398
</p>
<p><strong>3. A sum of money is lent at 8% per annum compound interest. If the interest for the second year exceeds that for the first year by </strong>₹<strong>96, find the sum of money.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume the money lent to be ₹100
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹100; R = 8% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest for the first year = (100 x 8 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹8
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(100+ 8)
</p>
<p>
= ₹108
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹108; R = 8% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest for the second year = (108 x 8 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹8.64
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
Difference between the interests for the second and first year = ₹(8.64 &#8211; 8) = ₹0.64
</p>
<p>
But given that interest for the second year exceeds the first year by ₹96
</p>
<p>
Then,
</p>
<p>
When the difference between the interests is ₹0.64, principal is ₹100
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
When the difference between the interests is ₹96, principal = ₹(96 x 100/0.64)
</p>
<p>
= ₹15,000
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the sum of money lent is ₹15,000
</p>
<p><strong>4. A man borrows </strong>₹<strong>6,000 at 5% C.I. per annum. If he repays </strong>₹<strong>1,200 at the end of each year, find the amount of the loan outstanding at the beginning of the third year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Given, amount borrowed = ₹6,000 at R = 5% C.I. per annum
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 1<sup>st</sup> year = (5/100 x 6000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹300
</p>
<p>
And, the amount at the end of the first year will be
</p>
<p>
= ₹(6,000 + 300)
</p>
<p>
= ₹6,300
</p>
<p>
Given that an amount of ₹1,200 is repaid at the end of each year
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
The amount left to the paid at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
= ₹(6,300 – 1,200)
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,100
</p>
<p>
Then, the interest for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year is
</p>
<p>
= (5/100 x 5100)
</p>
<p>
= ₹255
</p>
<p>
And, the amount will be = ₹(5100 + 255)
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,355
</p>
<p>
Now, the amount left to be paid at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> year after reduction of ₹1,200 will be
</p>
<p>
= ₹(5,355 – 1,200)
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,155
</p>
<p>
Hence, the amount of the loan outstanding at the beginning of the third year is ₹4,155
</p>
<p><strong>5. A man borrows </strong>₹<strong>5,000 at 12 percent compound interest payable every six months. He repays </strong>₹<strong>1,800 at the end of every six months. Calculate the third payment he has to make at the end of 18 months in order to clear the entire loan.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> six months:
</p>
<p>
P = ₹5,000; R = 12% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (5000 x 12 x 1)/(2 x 100)
</p>
<p>
= ₹300
</p>
<p>
And, Amount = ₹(5,000 + 300)
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,300
</p>
<p>
Given that the money repaid = ₹1,800
</p>
<p>
So, balance amount = ₹(5,300 &#8211; 1,800)
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,500
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> six months:
</p>
<p>
P = ₹3,500; R = 12% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (3500 x 12 x 1)/(2 x 100)
</p>
<p>
= ₹210
</p>
<p>
And, Amount = ₹(3,500 + 210)
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,710
</p>
<p>
Again the money repaid = ₹1,800
</p>
<p>
So, balance amount = ₹(3,710 &#8211; 1,800)
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,910
</p>
<p><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> six months:
</p>
<p>
P = ₹1,910; R = 12% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (1910 x 12 x 1)/(2 x 100)
</p>
<p>
= ₹114.60
</p>
<p>
And, Amount = ₹(1,910 + 114.60)
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,024.60
</p>
<p>
Hence, the 3<sup>rd</sup> payment to be made to clear the entire loan is ₹2,024.60
</p>
<p><strong>6. On a certain sum of money, the difference between the compound interest for a year, payable half-yearly, and the simple interest for a year is </strong>₹<strong>180. Find the sum lent out, if the rate of interest in both the cases is 10% per annum.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Let assume a principal of ₹100
</p>
<p>
And, for R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
S.I. = (100 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹10
</p>
<p>
Compound interest payable half yearly
</p>
<p>
R = 5% half-yearly, T = ½ year = 1 half-year
</p>
<p>
Now, for first ½ year
</p>
<p>
I = (100 x 5 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹5
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(100 + 5)
</p>
<p>
= ₹105
</p>
<p>
For second ½ year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹105 and R = 5%
</p>
<p>
I = (105 x 5 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹5.25
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Total compound interest = ₹(5 + 5.25)
</p>
<p>
= ₹10.25
</p>
<p>
Difference of C.I. and S.I. = ₹(10.25 – 10)
</p>
<p>
= ₹0.25
</p>
<p>
So, when difference in interest is ₹10.25, the sum is ₹100
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
So, if the difference is ₹1, the sum is (100/0.25) = 400
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
If the difference is ₹180, the sum will be ₹(400 x 180) =  ₹72,000
</p>
<p>
Hence, the sum lent out is ₹72,000
</p>
<p><strong>7. A manufacturer estimates that his machine depreciates by 15% of its value at the beginning of the year. Find the original value (cost) of the machine, if it depreciates by </strong>₹<strong>5,355 during the second year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume the original cost of the machine to be ₹100
</p>
<p>
Given that the machine depreciates by 15% during the first year
</p>
<p>
So, 15% of ₹100 = ₹15
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
The value of the machine at the beginning of the 2<sup>nd</sup> year will be
</p>
<p>
= ₹(100 – 15)
</p>
<p>
= ₹85
</p>
<p>
Again, the depreciation during the 2<sup>nd</sup> year = 15% of ₹85 = ₹12.75
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
When the depreciation during the 2<sup>nd</sup> year is ₹12.75, the original cost is ₹100
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
When the depreciation during the 2<sup>nd</sup> year is ₹5,355, the original cost will be
</p>
<p>
= (100 x 5355)/12.75
</p>
<p>
= ₹42,000
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the original cost of the machine is ₹42,000
</p>
<p><strong>8. A man invest </strong>₹<strong>5,600 at 14% per annum compound interest for 2 years. Calculate:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) The interest for the first year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(ii) The amount at the end of the first year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(iii) The interest for the second year, correct to the nearest rupee.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
(i) For the 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹5,600; R = 14% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (5600 x 14 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹784
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
(ii) Amount at the end of the first year is
</p>
<p>
= ₹(5600 + 784)
</p>
<p>
= ₹6,384
</p>
<p>
(iii) Now, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹6,384; R = 14% and R = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (6384 x 14 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹893.76 ~ ₹894 (nearly)
</p>
<p>
Hence, the interest for the second year is ₹894
</p>
<p><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>9. A man saves </strong>₹<strong>3,000 every year and invests it at the end of the year at 10% compound interest. Calculate the total amount of his savings at the end of the third year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Savings at the end of every year = ₹3,000
</p>
<p>
So, for 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹3,000; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (3000 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹300
</p>
<p>
And, 
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(3000 + 300)
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,300
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> year, savings = ₹3,000
</p>
<p>
So, P = ₹(3,000 + 3,300) = ₹6,300
</p>
<p>
R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
I = (6300 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹630
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(6,300 + 630) = ₹6,930
</p>
<p>
Amount at the end of 3<sup>rd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
= ₹(6,930 + 3,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹9,930
</p>
<p>
Hence, the total amount of his savings at the end of the third year is ₹9,930
</p>
<p><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>10. A man borrows </strong>₹<strong>10,000 at 5% per annum compound interest. He repays 35% of the sum borrowed at the end of the first year and 42% of the sum borrowed at the end of the second year. How much must he pay at the end of the third year in order to clear the debt?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Given,
</p>
<p>
The amount borrowed is ₹10,000 at R = 5%
</p>
<p>
Interest for the 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
I = (10000 x 5)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹500
</p>
<p>
And, the amount at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> year = ₹(10,000 + 500)
</p>
<p>
= ₹10,500
</p>
<p>
It’s said that the man pays 35% of ₹10,500 at the end of the first year
</p>
<p>
= (35 x 10500)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,675
</p>
<p>
So, the amount left to be paid will be
</p>
<p>
= ₹(10,500 – 3,675)
</p>
<p>
= ₹6,825
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
The interest for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year is
</p>
<p>
I = (6,825 x 5)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹341.5
</p>
<p>
So, the amount at the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> year will be
</p>
<p>
= ₹(6,825 + 341.25)
</p>
<p>
= ₹7,166.25
</p>
<p>
Given that the man pays 42% of ₹7,166.25 at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
= (42 x 7166.25)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,009.825
</p>
<p>
So, the amount left to be paid = ₹(7,166.25 – 3,009.825)
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,156.425
</p>
<p>
Now, the interest for the third year
</p>
<p>
= (4156.425 x 5)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹207.82125
</p>
<p>
So, the amount at the end of the third year will be
</p>
<p>
= (4,156.425 + 207.82125)
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,364.24625
</p>
<p>
Hence, the man must pay an amount of ₹4,364.24625 at the end of 3<sup>rd</sup> year in order to clear the debt.
</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2(C)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. A sum is invested at compound interest, compounded yearly. If the interest for two successive years is </strong>₹<strong>5,700 and </strong>₹<strong>7,410, calculate the rate of interest.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
We know that.
</p>
<p>
Rate of interest (%) = (Difference in the interest of the two consecutive periods x 100)/(C.I. of preceding year x time)
</p>
<p>
= [(7410 &#8211; 5700) x 100]/(5700 x 1)
</p>
<p>
= 30%
</p>
<p>
Hence, the rate of interest is 30%
</p>
<p><strong>2. A certain sum of money is put at compound interest, compounded half-yearly. If the interest for two successive half-years are </strong>₹<strong>650 and </strong>₹<strong>760.50; find the rate of interest.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The difference between the C.I. of two successive half-years is
</p>
<p>
= ₹(760.50 – 650)
</p>
<p>
= ₹110.50
</p>
<p>
So, ₹110.50 is the interest of one half-year on ₹650
</p>
<p>
Thus,
</p>
<p>
Rate of interest = (100 x I)/(P x T) %
</p>
<p>
= (100 x 110.50)/(650 x ½)
</p>
<p>
 = 34%
</p>
<p><strong>3. A certain sum amounts to </strong>₹<strong>5,292 in two years and </strong>₹<strong>5,556.60 in three years, interest being compounded annually. Find:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) the rate of interest.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(ii) the original sum.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
(i) Given,
</p>
<p>
Amount in two years = ₹5,292
</p>
<p>
Amount in three years = ₹5,556.60
</p>
<p>
So, the difference between the amounts of two successive years is
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,556.60 &#8211; ₹5,292
</p>
<p>
= ₹264.60
</p>
<p>
Hence, ₹264.60 is the interest for one year on ₹5,292
</p>
<p>
Thus,
</p>
<p>
Rate of interest = (100 x I)/(P x T)
</p>
<p>
= (100 x 264.60)/(5292 x 1)
</p>
<p>
= 5%
</p>
<p>
(ii) Let’s assume the sum of money to be ₹100
</p>
<p>
Then, the interest on it for the 1<sup>st</sup> year will be
</p>
<p>
= 5% of ₹100
</p>
<p>
= ₹5
</p>
<p>
So, the amount in one year = ₹(100 + 5) = ₹105
</p>
<p>
Similarly,
</p>
<p>
The amount in two years = ₹105 + 5% of ₹105
</p>
<p>
= ₹(105+ 5.25)
</p>
<p>
= ₹110.25
</p>
<p>
When amount in two years is ₹110.25, sum = ₹100
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
When amount in two years is ₹5,292, sum = ₹(100 x 5292)/110.25
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,800
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
(i) C.I. for second year = ₹1,089
</p>
<p>
C.I. for third year = ₹1,197.90
</p>
<p>
Thus, the difference between the C.I. of two successive years
</p>
<p>
= ₹(1,197.90 – 1,089)
</p>
<p>
= ₹108.90
</p>
<p>
Hence, ₹108.90 is the interest of one year on ₹1,089
</p>
<p>
Thus,
</p>
<p>
Rate of interest = (100 x I)/(P x T)
</p>
<p>
= (100 x 108.90)/(1089 x 1)
</p>
<p>
= 10%
</p>
<p>
(ii) Let’s assume the sum of money to be ₹100
</p>
<p>
So, interest on it for in the 1<sup>st</sup> year = 10% of ₹100
</p>
<p>
= ₹10
</p>
<p>
And, the amount after one year = ₹(100 + 10)
</p>
<p>
= ₹110
</p>
<p>
Similarly, C.I. for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year = 10% of ₹110
</p>
<p>
= ₹11
</p>
<p>
When C.I. for 2<sup>nd</sup> year is ₹11, the sum is ₹100
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
When C.I. for 2<sup>nd</sup> year is ₹1,089, the sum is ₹(100 x 1089)/11 = ₹9,900
</p>
<p><strong>5. Mohit invests </strong>₹<strong>8,000 for 3 years at a certain rate of interest, compounded annually. At the end of one year it amounts to </strong>₹<strong>9,440. Calculate:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) the rate of interest per annum.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(ii) the amount at the end of the second year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(iii) the interest accrued in the third year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
For the 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹8,000; A = ₹9,440 and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(9,440 &#8211; 8,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,440
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Rate = (I x 100)/(P x T)
</p>
<p>
= (1,440 x 100)/(8,000 x 1
</p>
<p>
= 18%
</p>
<p>
(i) Hence, the rate of interest per annum is 18%
</p>
<p>
For the 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹9,440; R = 18% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (9440 x 18 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,699.20
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹ (9,440 + 1,699.20) = ₹11,139.20
</p>
<p>
(ii) Hence, the amount at the end of second year is ₹11,139.20
</p>
<p>
For the 3<sup>rd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹11,139.20; R = 18% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (11139.20 x 18 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,005.06
</p>
<p>
(iii) Hence, the interest accrued in the third year is ₹2,005.06
</p>
<p><strong>6. Geeta borrowed </strong>₹<strong>15,000 for 18 months at a certain rate of interest compounded semi-annually. If at the end of six months it amounted to </strong>₹<strong>15,600; Calculate :</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) the rate of interest per annum.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(ii) the total amount of money that Geeta must pay at the end of 18 months in order to clear the account.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> half-year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹15,000; A = ₹15,600 and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(15,600 &#8211; 15,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹600
</p>
<p>
(i) Hence,
</p>
<p>
Rate = (I x 100)/(P x T)%
</p>
<p>
= 8%
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> half-year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹15,600; R = 8% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (15,000 x 8 x ½)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹624
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(15,600 + 624)
</p>
<p>
= ₹16,224
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> half-year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹16,224; R = 8% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (16,224 x 8 x ½)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹648.96
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(16,224 + 648.96)
</p>
<p>
= ₹16,872.96
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the total amount of money that Geeta must pay at the end of 18 months in order to clear the account is ₹16,872.96

<p><strong>7. Ramesh invests </strong>₹<strong>12,800 for three years at the rate of 10% per annum compound interest. Find:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) the sum due to Ramesh at the end of the first year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(ii) the interest he earns for the second year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(iii) the total amount due to him at the end of the third year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹12,800; R = 10% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (12,800 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,280
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(12,800 +1,280)
</p>
<p>
= ₹14,080
</p>
<p>
(i) Hence, at the sum due to Ramesh at the end of the first year is ₹14,080
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹14,080; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (14,080 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,408
</p>
<p>
(ii) Hence, the interest the interest earned for the second year is ₹1,408
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(14,080 + 1,408)
</p>
<p>
= ₹15,488
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹15,488; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(15,488 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,548.80
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(15,488 + 1,548.80)
</p>
<p>
= ₹17,036.80
</p>
<p>
(iii) Hence, the total amount due to Ramesh at the end of third year is ₹17,036.80
</p>
<p><strong>8. </strong>₹<strong>8,000 is lent out at 7% compound interest for 2 years. At the end of the first year </strong>₹<strong>3,560 are returned. Calculate:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) the interest paid for the second year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(ii) the total interest paid in two years.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(iii) the total amount of money paid in two years to clear the debt.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
(i) For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹8,000; R = 7% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (8,000 x 7 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹560
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(8,000 + 560)
</p>
<p>
= ₹8,560
</p>
<p>
Now, the money returned = ₹3,560
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Balance money for 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹(8,560 &#8211; 3,560)
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,000
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹5,000; R = 7% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest paid for the second year = (5000 x 7 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹350
</p>
<p>
(ii) The total interest paid in two years = ₹(350 + 560)
</p>
<p>
= ₹910
</p>
<p>
(iii) The total amount of money paid in two years to clear the debt
</p>
<p>
= ₹(8,000 + 910)
</p>
<p>
= ₹8,910
</p>
<p><strong>9. The cost of a machine depreciated by </strong>₹<strong>4,000 during the first year and by </strong>₹<strong>3,600 during the second year. Calculate:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) The rate of depreciation</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(ii) The original cost of the machine</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(iii) It’s cost at the end of the third year</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
(i) Difference between depreciation in value between the first and second years is
</p>
<p>
₹(4,000 &#8211; 3,600) = ₹400
</p>
<p>
So, the depreciation of one year on ₹4,000 = ₹400
</p>
<p>
Hence, the rate of depreciation = (40/4000) x 100%
</p>
<p>
= 10%
</p>
<p>
(ii) Let’s assume ₹100 to be the original cost of the machine
</p>
<p>
Depreciation during the 1<sup>st</sup> year = 10% of ₹100
</p>
<p>
= ₹10
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
When the values depreciates by Rs.10 during the 1<sup>st</sup> year, then the original cost is ₹100
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Then, when the depreciation during 1<sup>st</sup> year is ₹4,000, the original cost is
</p>
<p>
(100/10) x 4,000 = ₹40,000
</p>
<p>
Hence, the original cost of the machine is ₹40,000.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
(iii) Total depreciation during all the three years
</p>
<p>
= Depreciation in value during (1<sup>st</sup> year + 2<sup>nd</sup> year + 3<sup>rd</sup> year)
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,000 + ₹3,600 + 10% of (₹40,000 &#8211; ₹7,600)
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,000 + ₹3,600 + ₹3,240
</p>
<p>
= ₹10,840
</p>
<p>
Thus,
</p>
<p>
The cost of the machine at the end of the third year = ₹40,000 &#8211; ₹10,840
</p>
<p>
= ₹29,160
</p>
<p><strong>10. Find the sum, invested at 10% compounded annually, on which the interest for the third year exceeds the interest of the first year by </strong>₹<strong>252.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume the sum of money be ₹100
</p>
<p>
And, the rate of interest = 10% p.a.
</p>
<p>
Interest at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> year = 10% of ₹100
</p>
<p>
= ₹10
</p>
<p>
Amount at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> year = ₹(100 + 10)
</p>
<p>
= ₹110
</p>
<p>
Interest at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> year = 10% of ₹110
</p>
<p>
= ₹11
</p>
<p>
Amount at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹(110 + 11)
</p>
<p>
= ₹121
</p>
<p>
Interest at the end of 3<sup>rd</sup> year = 10% of ₹121
</p>
<p>
= ₹12.10
</p>
<p>
Hence, the difference between interest of 3<sup>rd</sup> year and 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
= ₹(12.10 – 10)
</p>
<p>
= ₹2.10
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
When difference is ₹2.10, the principal is ₹100
</p>
<p>
When difference is ₹252, the principal = (100 x 252)/(2 x 10)
</p>
<p>
= ₹12,000
</p>
<p>
Hence, the sum invested is ₹12,000
</p>
<p><strong>11. A man borrows </strong>₹<strong>10,000 at 10% compound interest compounded yearly. At the end of each year, he pays back 30% of the sum borrowed. How much money is left unpaid just after the second year?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹10,000; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (10,000 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,000
</p>
<p>
Amount at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> year = ₹(10,000 + 1,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹11,000
</p>
<p>
Money paid at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> year = 30% of ₹10,000
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,000
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
Principal for 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹(11,000 &#8211; 3,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹8,000
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹8,000; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (8,000 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
  = ₹800
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹8,000 + ₹800
</p>
<p>
= ₹8,800
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Money paid at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> year = 30% of ₹10,000
</p>
<p>
= ₹3,000
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
The principal for 3<sup>rd</sup> year = ₹8,800 &#8211; ₹3,000
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,800
</p>
<p><strong>12. A man borrows </strong>₹<strong>10,000 at 10% compound interest compounded yearly. At the end of each year, he pays back 20% of the amount for that year. How much money is left unpaid just after the second year?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹10,000; R = 10% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(10,000 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,000
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Amount at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> year = ₹(10,000 + 1,000)
</p>
<p>
= ₹11,000
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Money paid at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> year = 20% of ₹11,000
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,200
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
Principal for 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹11,000 &#8211; ₹2,200 = ₹8,800
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹8,800; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(8,000 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹880
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
Amount at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹8,800 + ₹880
</p>
<p>
= ₹9,680
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Money paid at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> year = 20% of ₹9,680
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,936
</p>
<p>
Hence,
</p>
<p>
Principal for 3<sup>rd</sup> year = ₹9,680 &#8211; ₹1,936
</p>
<p>
= ₹7,744
</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2(D)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. What sum will amount of </strong>₹<strong>6,593.40 in 2 years at C.I., if the rates are 10 per cent and 11 per cent for the two successive years?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume the principal (P) to be ₹100
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year, we have
</p>
<p>
P = ₹100; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
I = (100 x 10 x 1)/100\
</p>
<p>
= ₹10
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(100 + 10) = ₹110
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year, we have
</p>
<p>
P = ₹110;R = 11% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
I = (110 x 11 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹12.10
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
A = ₹(110 + 12.10)
</p>
<p>
= ₹122.10
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
If the amount is ₹122.10 for a sum of ₹100
</p>
<p>
Then,
</p>
<p>
If amount is ₹1, sum will be ₹(100/122.10)
</p>
<p>
And, 
</p>
<p>
If amount is ₹6,593.40, sum will be ₹(100/122.10) x 6,593.40 = ₹5,400
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the sum is ₹5,400
</p>
<p><strong>2. The value of a machine depreciated by 10% per year during the first two years and 15% per year during the third year. Express the total depreciation of the machine, as per cent, during the three years.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume the value of machine in the beginning to be ₹100
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year,
</p>
<p>
Depreciation = 10% of ₹100
</p>
<p>
= ₹100
</p>
<p>
So, the value of machine for second year will become ₹(100 – 10) = ₹90
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year,
</p>
<p>
Depreciation = 10% of ₹90 = ₹9
</p>
<p>
So, the value of machine for third year will become ₹(90 – 9) = ₹81
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> year,
</p>
<p>
Depreciation = 15% of ₹81 = ₹12.15
</p>
<p>
So, the value of machine at the end of third year = ₹(81 &#8211; 12.15) = ₹68.85
</p>
<p>
Thus,
</p>
<p>
Net depreciation = ₹(100 &#8211; 68.85) = ₹31.15
</p>
<p>
Or 31.15%

<p><strong>3. Rachna borrows </strong>₹<strong>12,000 at 10 percent per annum interest compounded half-yearly. She repays </strong>₹<strong>4,000 at the end of every six months. Calculate the third payment she has to make at end of 18 months in order to clear the entire loan.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> half-year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹12,000; R = 10% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(12,000 x 10 x 1)/(100 x 2)
</p>
<p>
= ₹600
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹12,000 + ₹600
</p>
<p>
= ₹12,600
</p>
<p>
Money paid at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> half year = ₹4,000
</p>
<p>
So, the balance money for 2<sup>nd</sup> half-year = ₹12,600 &#8211; ₹4,000
</p>
<p>
= ₹8,600
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> half-year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹8,600; R = 10% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(8,600 x 10 x 1)/(100 x 2)
</p>
<p>
= ₹430
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹8,600 + ₹430
</p>
<p>
= ₹9,030
</p>
<p>
Money paid at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> half-year = ₹4,000
</p>
<p>
So, the balance money for 3<sup>rd</sup> half-year = ₹9,030 &#8211; ₹4,000
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,030
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> half-year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹5,030; R = 10% and T = ½ year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(5,030 x 10 x 1)/(100 x 2)
</p>
<p>
= ₹251.50
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(5,030 + 251.50)
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,281.50
</p>
<p>
Hence, Rachna has to pay an amount of ₹5,281.50 as third payment in order to clear the entire loan
</p>
<p><strong>4. On a certain sum of money, invested at the rate of 10 percent per annum compounded annually, the interest for the first year plus the interest for the third year is </strong>₹<strong>2,652. Find the sum.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume the principal as ₹100
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹100; R = 10% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(100 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹10
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(100 + 10)
</p>
<p>
= ₹110
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹110; R = 10% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(110 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹11
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹(110 + 11)
</p>
<p>
= ₹121
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹121; R = 10% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(121 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹12.10
</p>
<p>
Sum of C.I. for 1<sup>st</sup> year and 3<sup>rd</sup> year = ₹(10 + 12.10)
</p>
<p>
= ₹22.10
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
When sum is ₹22.10, principal is ₹100
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
When sum is ₹2,652, principal will be (100 x 2652)/22.10 = ₹12,000
</p>
<p>
Hence, the sum is ₹12,000
</p>
<p><strong>5. During every financial year, the value of a machine depreciates by 12%. Find the original cost of a machine which depreciates by </strong>₹<strong>2,640 during the second financial year of its purchase.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume the original value of the machine to be ₹100
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹100; R = 12% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Depreciation in 1<sup>st</sup> year = ₹(100 x 12 x 1)/100 
</p>
<p>
= ₹12
</p>
<p>
Value at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> year = ₹(100 – 12)
</p>
<p>
= ₹88
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹88; R = 12% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Depreciation in 2<sup>nd</sup> year = ₹(88 x 12 x 1)/100 
</p>
<p>
= ₹10.56
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
When depreciation in 2<sup>nd</sup> year is ₹10.56, original cost is ₹100
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
When depreciation in 2<sup>nd</sup> year is ₹2,640, original cost will be (100 x 2,640)/10.56
</p>
<p>
= ₹25,000
</p>
<p>
Hence, the original cost of the machine is ₹25,000
</p>
<p><strong>6. Find the sum on which the difference between the simple interest and compound interest at the rate of 8% per annum compounded annually would be </strong>₹<strong>64 in 2years.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume ₹x to be the sum. 
</p>
<p>
So, the S.I. is
</p>
<p>
= (x × 8 × 2)/100
</p>
<p>
= 0.16x
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
Compound interest
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year:
</p>
<p>
P = ₹x, R = 8% and T = 1
</p>
<p>
Interest = (x × 8 × 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= 0.08x
</p>
<p>
And, amount = ₹(x + 0.08x)
</p>
<p>
= ₹1.08x<br />
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year:
</p>
<p>
P = ₹1.08x, R = 8% and T = 1
</p>
<p>
Interest = (1.08x × 8 × 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= 0.0864x
</p>
<p>
And, amount = ₹(1.08x + 0.0864x)
</p>
<p>
= ₹1.1664x
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
C.I. = Amount &#8211; P
</p>
<p>
= ₹(1.1664x – x)
</p>
<p>
= ₹0.1664x
</p>
<p>
Given that,
</p>
<p>
The difference between the simple interest and compound interest at the rate of 8% per annum compounded annually should be ₹64 in 2 years.
</p>
<p>
₹0.1664<em>x</em> &#8211; ₹0.16<em>x</em> = ₹64
</p>
<p>
₹0.0064<em>x</em> = ₹64
</p>
<p>
x = ₹10000
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the sum is ₹10,000.
</p>
<p><strong>7. A sum of </strong>₹<strong>13,500 is invested at 16% per annum compound interest for 5 years. Calculate:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) the interest for the first year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(ii) the amount at the end of first year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(iii) the interest for the second year, correct to the nearest rupee.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹13,500; R = 16% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(13,500 x 16 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,160
</p>
<p>
(i) The interest for the first year is ₹2,160
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹13,500 + ₹2,160
</p>
<p>
= ₹15,660
</p>
<p>
(ii) The amount at the end of first year is ₹15,660
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹15,660; R =16% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(15,660 x 16 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,505.60
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,506 (corrected to the nearest rupee)
</p>
<p>
(iii) Hence, the interest for the second year is ₹2,506
</p>
<p><strong>8. Saurabh invests ₹48,000 for 7 years at 10% per annum compound interest.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Calculate:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) the interest for the first year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(ii) the amount at the end of second year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(iii) the interest for the third year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹48,000; R = 10% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(48,000 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹4,800
</p>
<p>
(i) Hence, the interest for the first year is ₹4,800
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹48,000 + ₹4,800
</p>
<p>
= ₹52,800
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹52,800; R = 10% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(52,800 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,280
</p>
<p>
And,
</p>
<p>
Amount = ₹52,800 + ₹5,280 = ₹58,080
</p>
<p>
(ii) Hence, the amount at the end of second year is ₹58,080
</p>
<p>
For 3<sup>rd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹58,080; R = 10% and T = 1year
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(58,080 x 10 x 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹5,808
</p>
<p>
(iii) Hence, the interest for the third year is ₹5,808
</p>
<p><strong>9. Ashok borrowed </strong>₹<strong>12,000 at some rate on compound interest. After a year, he paid back </strong>₹<strong>4,000. If the compound interest for the second year is </strong>₹<strong>920, find:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>i. The rate of interest charged</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ii. The amount of debt at the end of the second year</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
(i) Let’s assume x% to be the rate of interest charged
</p>
<p>
Then C.I, calculated
</p>
<p>
For 1<sup>st</sup> year
</p>
<p>
P = ₹12,000, R = x% and T = 1 year
</p>
<p>
Interest = (12,000 × x × 1)/100
</p>
<p>
= 120x
</p>
<p>
And, amount = ₹(12,000 + 120x)
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year
</p>
<p>
After a year, given that Ashok paid back ₹4,000.
</p>
<p>
P = (₹12,000 + ₹120x) &#8211; ₹4,000 = ₹(8,000 + 120x)
</p>
<p>
Interest = [(8,000 + 120x) × x × 1]/100
</p>
<p>
= ₹(80x + 1.20x<sup>2</sup>)
</p>
<p>
But given,
</p>
<p>
The compound interest for the second year is ₹920
</p>
<p>
₹(80x + 1.20x<sup>2</sup>) = ₹920
</p>
<p>
1.20x<sup>2</sup> + 80x &#8211; 920 = 0
</p>
<p>
3x<sup>2</sup> + 200x &#8211; 2300 = 0
</p>
<p>
3x<sup>2</sup> + 230x &#8211; 30x &#8211; 2300 = 0
</p>
<p>
x(3x + 230) -10(3x + 230) = 0
</p>
<p>
(3x + 230) (x &#8211; 10) = 0
</p>
<p>
x = -230/3 or x = 10
</p>
<p>
Since, the rate of interest cannot be negative
</p>
<p>
So, x = 10
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the rate of interest charged is 10%.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
(ii) For 1<sup>st</sup> year:
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹120x = ₹1200
</p>
<p>
For 2<sup>nd</sup> year:
</p>
<p>
Interest = ₹(80x + 1.20x<sup>2</sup>) = ₹920
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The amount of debt at the end of the second year is equal to the sum of the principal of the second year and interest for the two years.
</p>
<p>
Thus,
</p>
<p>
Total debt = ₹(8,000 + 1,200 + 920) = ₹10,120
</p>
<p><strong>10. On a certain sum of money, lent out at C.I., interests for first, second and third years are </strong>₹<strong>1,500, </strong>₹<strong>1,725 and </strong>₹<strong>2,070 respectively. Find the rate of interest for the </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i) second year (ii) third year.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Given,
</p>
<p>
The interest obtained in the first year is ₹1,500
</p>
<p>
The interest obtained in the second year is ₹1,750
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
(i) Difference between the interests of second year and first year is
</p>
<p>
= ₹1,725 &#8211; ₹1,500
</p>
<p>
= ₹225
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
The rate of interest for the second year is calculated as
</p>
<p>
= (225/1,500) x 100
</p>
<p>
= 15%
</p>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
(ii) Difference between the interests of third year and second year is
</p>
<p>
= ₹2,070 &#8211; ₹1,725
</p>
<p>
= ₹345
</p>
<p>
So,
</p>
<p>
The rate of interest for the second year is calculated as
</p>
<p>
= (345/1,725) x 100
</p>
<p>
= 20%
</p>
