<h2>Selina Solutions for class 9 Physics Chapter 5 &#8211; Upthrust In Fluids, Archimedes&#8217; Principle and Floatation</h2>
<p>The chapter provides students with a deep understanding of various important concepts revolving around upthrust in fluids. Upthrust is the upward force acting on a body when it is partially or fully immersed in a liquid, it is also referred to as buoyant force. This concept has been demonstrated with the help of various examples.</p>
<p>The next important topic is Archimedes&#8217; Principle and its experimental verification. The concept of density and relative density can be clearly understood by students as it has been aided with sufficient examples and numerical problems along with worked example problems.</p>
<p>Principle of floatation is covered in the third section of the chapter and is elucidated with different applications that are relevant enough from the students&#8217; perspective.</p>

<p>Upthrust is also known as the buoyant force. It is the upward force acting on a body when it is partially or fully immersed in a liquid.</p>
</div></div></section><section itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name text">Why is a force needed to keep a block of wood inside water?</h3><div itemprop="suggestedAnswer acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text">
<p>An upward force, an upthrust is required to keep a block of wood in water as the upthrust due to water on the block when it is completely submerged is much more than its weight.</p>

<p>Archimedes’ principle states that when a body is immersed partially or completely in a liquid, it experiences an upthrust which is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by it.</p>
